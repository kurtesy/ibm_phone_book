Problem statement
    We would like you to develop a small piece of code to implement a simple HTTP service to represent a phone book.

Acceptance criteria.
    - List all entries in the phone book.
    - Create a new entry to the phone book.
    - Remove an existing entry in the phone book.
    - Update an existing entry in the phone book.
    - Search for entries in the phone book by surname.A phone book entry must contain the following details:
        - Surname
        - Firstname
        - Phone number
        - Address (optional)

The solution can be in any language (Whatever language you are most comfortable in). Please upload your project to github and provide us with the URL.
We are not looking for a client or UI for this solution, a simple HTTP based service will suffice.
